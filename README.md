# scrlttr2copy
A letter class option file for automatically creation of page copies.

The file `copy.lco` provides the new class option »copy« for the KOMA-Script
letter class »scrlttr2«. If the option »copy« is given all pages of a specific
letter are duplicated with background text marking as copies.

For more details see the example document `letter-copy-test.tex`.
